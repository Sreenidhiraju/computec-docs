## Plugins Pack Installation

The Plugins Pack is a WebClientExtension with the collection of plugins that are activated for a company. The Plugins Pack is unique for each company, hence this process needs to be carried out separately for each company. To access the CompuTec plugins in the SAP Business One Web Client, plugin pack installation is mandatory. This feature ensures centralized management and deployment across desired environments.

**Steps to install the Plugins Pack**:

1. Log into the AppEngine Administration Panel.

## Configuring CORS Settings

**Key steps for configuring CORS**:

1. Identify the domains that requires access to the Web Client.
2. Update the configuration file with the approved domains.
3. Test the integration to ensure everything functions correctly.
